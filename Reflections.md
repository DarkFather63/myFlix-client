###MyFlixCinema App###

##About##
This is a SPA app built using MERN stack technology, and is meant to display a database of movies for users to interact with by adding to their favorites and creating a profile.

##My Role & Thoughts##
I built this project from scratch, and this particular part of the project was the client side for the API I built previously. The client side uses React, JSX, Redux, React Bootstrap, and Axios, in combination with some dependencies like Parcel. I faced a lot of debugging with current updates to these libraries and frameworks, and in the process learned more about them.

A lot of keywords have changed over the past couple of years, and the guide I used to build the app was a bit outdated. I had to cross-reference issues, collaborate with classmates and tutors, and sometimes just sit and review or make notes. In some cases I had to use updated versions of dependencies, because the components previously used had been removed or were no longer supported. In these cases there was a lot of research to be done.

If I could, I would start the whole project over with up-to-date libraries and frameworks, and study their documentation more thoroughly. Even with the study I did, I did have to outsource problems; however it was usually out of the need for a fresh set of eyes.

These are the dependencies installed for the project. These versions must be used for the project to run. To learn more, visit the repo and check out the README file. The server side also uses Express and is hosted on MongoDB atlas and Heroku. Postman was also used to test endpoints. And in the client side, propTypes is also used to pass props to components where needed (in some cases redux is used instead).

Other notes:
This app was built based on the following user stories:
As a user, I want to be able to access information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.
 							
 As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.
